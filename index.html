            <p> As I mentioned above, my hobby of drawing started when I was 6.At first, I was just using colors to paint. I used just to draw some random pictures. I used to draw something every day. That is how I developed my drawing skills. I used to take part in various competitions. I was very interested in taking part in multiple events. I won a trophie for the Swatch Bharat Art Exellence Award at the age of 6 in class 2.
                <br><br>I was the state level winner in Assam. Apart from that, when I improved my skill, I started painting for others.I also take music classes. I used to draw for my friends, cousins, and family members. I used to participate in school events. I am popular among my friends in my school . Everyone wanted to make drawing for them. It gave me more motivation to do something new and to upgrade my skill.
